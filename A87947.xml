            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Maſter <hi>Hatcher</hi> and his Company with the Treatie, and the Money, came to <hi>Leith</hi> road <hi>November</hi> 21. ſo long a time it pleaſed God to keep him on Sea, and thereby by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our patience.</p>

            <p>The neereſt Regements are appointed to march preſently towards the borders, there to quarter and exerciſe themſelves, and to meet with the Cavaleeres, if any of them ſhall appeare till the day of Randevous.</p>
            <p>Conſider with your ſelfe, what time you will allow for ſending the Orders to the Shires, to call the Committees of the ſeverall Shires, to bring together the Souldiers to their Colours, and to march as farre as <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke,</hi> from which ſome of the Regiments are no leſſe then a hundred miles diſtant; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have impartially conſidered theſe and other ſuch neceſſary duties and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you will not condemne us of delayes or ſlackneſſe.</p>

            <p>Our Councels were toſſed betwixt two extremities, upon the one hand to bring them away, was to give up that Kingdome into the hands of Papiſts and Rebels; to ſuffer the poore Proteſtants there either to be driven forth, and to come upon us for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, or their throats to be cut by their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, which hath deſtroyed ſo many alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and to make the Rebels ſtrong and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for invading theſe two Kingdomes. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other hand, to keepe them there, and to feed them with promiſes, and really to ſtarve them, as we have done for a long time were to fall in the like barbarity.</p>
            <p>In this perplexity, we have beene forced to diſpatch from <hi>Air</hi> 4000 bolls of meall,

               <!-- PDF PAGE 60 -->which we had provided for the Weſtern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, and are providing other neceſſaries to be ſent unto the with diligence.

And hath taken up a great part of our time, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Comiſſioners here doe know; and the wiſe there cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>
            <p>The act of publike faith is alſo concluded, and ſent up that there be nothingwanting on our part: No ſooner did the Committee of the convention of Eſtates reſolve upon the day of generall randevous, but the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of the generall aſſembly in their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Edenbrugh,</hi> have appointed a publike faſt and humiliation for a bleſſing from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon our expedition, which is to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly kept in the Army, &amp; in all the Kirks of the Kingdome <hi>Jan.</hi> 7. being the Lords day, and the wedneſday following according to the warning ſent to all the Presbitaries and the particular cauſes expreſſed therein, which I have herewith ſent unto you.</p>
